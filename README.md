This project uses the tweepy library to get information related to the tweets that we are looking for using certain words (query).

## Notes about the project
The reply/discussion count is not available in the tweepy library.
It is available in twitterâ€™s API, however it requires premium membership [(Reference)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47851662/reply-count-attribute-missing-from-tweet-object). Instead, I decided to display the @ name of the user.

You can check the sorting method by putting the desired column at the beginning of sort_values.

```
sorted_df = df.sort_values(["Favorite count", "Retweet count", "Date of the tweet", "Discussion"], ascending=(False, False, False, False))
```
